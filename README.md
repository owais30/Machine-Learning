# Machine-Learning

Machine learning is field new world which is developing with very high rate.

I am creating this repository for basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.

Lets look at machine learning ......

## Definations
### Arthur Samuel (1959) 
  Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
    
### Tom Mitchell (1998) 
   A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its                  performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

## Types of Machine Learing

### Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning algorithms deals with the problems where both input and desired output data are provided

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised machine learning is opposite to supervise. This deals with the problems where only input data is provided and 
machine learns about the desired output.
